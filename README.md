# **Curriculum Version Control System**

## **Domain**: Education

### **Problem Statement**
Educational institutions frequently update their course materials, lecture slides, textbooks, and resources. Without version control, it is difficult for instructors and students to track changes, compare versions, or ensure consistency.

### **Challenges**
- **Difficulty Tracking Curriculum Changes**: Educators often struggle to track the evolution of course materials.
- **Risk of Using Outdated Materials**: There is a risk of using outdated resources or inconsistent versions across different classrooms.
- **Lack of Centralized Access**: Without a centralized system, instructors and students may not easily access or compare previous versions of course content.

### **Solution Overview**
The **Curriculum Version Control System** uses **S3 Versioning** to store and manage versions of curriculum resources such as lecture slides, textbooks, and PDFs. This system ensures that educators and students can track changes and revert to previous versions as needed, ensuring consistency and clarity in course delivery.

### **How It Solves the Problem**
S3 Versioning ensures that all updates to course materials are properly tracked and stored. This makes it easy to retrieve, compare, and reference previous versions for consistency and historical review, providing a centralized system for educators and students.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Store Curriculum Materials in S3**: All course materials (e.g., slides, books, PDFs) will be stored in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
2. **Track Changes and Versions**: Each update or change to a file will be saved as a new version, ensuring that educators and students can easily compare versions.
3. **Comparison Tools for Educators**: Tools will be provided to allow instructors to compare different versions of course materials and track the changes over time.

---

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Curriculum Materials**: Ensure every update to a file is saved as a new version to prevent overwriting and allow historical reference.
- **Metadata Tracking**: Manage metadata related to curriculum materials such as course name, version, and creation date for easy retrieval.
- **Version Comparison Tools**: Allow educators to view and compare different versions of course content to better track changes.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Upload Curriculum Materials to S3**: All course materials (e.g., lecture slides, textbooks, PDFs) will be uploaded to S3 with versioning enabled to track each update.
2. **Store Changes as New Versions**: Every time a change is made to a course material, a new version will be created and stored automatically in S3.
3. **Compare Different Versions**: Educators can use a web interface to compare different versions of materials, helping them track changes and make decisions based on past versions.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/curriculum-version-control-system.git
cd curriculum-version-control-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Enable S3 Versioning**

Run the `enable_versioning.py` script to enable versioning for your S3 bucket.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 3: Upload Curriculum Material**

To upload a new curriculum material, run the `upload_material.py` script. This will upload the material and store relevant metadata like course name and version.

```bash
python upload_material.py
```

### **Step 4: List and Compare Versions**

To list and compare different versions of a curriculum material, use the `list_versions.py` script.

```bash
python list_versions.py
```

## **Further Improvements**
- **LMS Integration**: Integrate with Learning Management Systems (LMS) to automatically update and synchronize curriculum content.
- **Student Assignment Versioning**: Allow version control for student-submitted assignments, ensuring teachers can track progress over time.
